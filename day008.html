    <p>In today's code we are going to learn about Classes vs. Ids</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 class="id">Ids are unique:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Each element can have only one ID.</li>
        <li>Each page can have only one element with that ID.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3 class="class">Classes are not unique:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You can use the same class on multiple elements.</li>
        <li>You can use multiple classes on the same element.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p8"><strong>Difference between id and class: </strong>“id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements. Any styling information that needs to be applied to multiple objects on a page should be done with a class.</p>
